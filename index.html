      The night air was bitterly cold, slicing into my very soul. It was, in a
      strange way, a welcome feeling. It was also slightly more bearable among
      my bare feet pressed firmly to the beach's shifting sands. A chilly winter
      breeze whirled off the glistening water, pulling my gaze away from the
      distant horizon.
    </div>

    <div class="text-shuffle">
      It was so easy to get lost in thought amidst this incredibly vague,
      surreal environment. I felt like I had gone through some sort of portal -
      into a land of reflection and inner truth. Something about this place was
      oddly calming, and for the first time in a long time, I let my defenses
      down and allowed myself to not only feel, but to think, decipher and
      determine why I was feeling vulnerable in this world.
    </div>

    <div class="text-shuffle">
      The beach had become my sanctuary. The ground beneath my feet felt oddly
      comforting with the softly-rolling grains of sand. It was just what I
      needed, if only for a brief moment. The ocean roared gracefully and I
      leaned forward onto my toes, savoring the release as the temperature of
      the sand embraced my feet. I felt safe and liberated, but I also knew this
      was a transient situation.
    </div>

    <div class="text-shuffle">
      I wondered what else the sand was revealing to me. What wisdom does the
      shifting sand hold?
    </div>

    <div class="text-shuffle">
      Digging deeper into my musings, I realized I felt somewhat ashamed of the
      person I had become after spending most of my life trying to make up for
      lost times, trying to find strength in things that could not be achieved
      fruitfully.
    </div>

    <div class="text-shuffle">
      Yes, I had worked hard and made some progress, but I had to bring myself
      back down to the ground and confront reality before I could truly know my
      boundaries. The foundation of my life and happiness had been nothing more
      than shifting sands. How much was I declined, neglected, or lost out in
      life? How much potential had I postponed?
    </div>

    <div class="text-shuffle">
      These were the questions I now faced on the beach.
    </div>

    <div class="text-shuffle">
      The sands beneath my toes humbled me as I realized that I had more
      personal equity and control over my future than I thought. Despite the
      lack of power in life, shifting my mental sandbanks would help me access
      courage and direction in it. It showed me I had the power to look at
      myself, my mistakes, my fears, and still strive for better.
